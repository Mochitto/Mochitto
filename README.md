## 🌸 Hello there!
I'm ✨ Mochi ✨ (or Mochitto!).
My pronouns are: They/them 🏳️‍🌈

I have a background in Japanese language and studies, and a passion for programming. 👩‍💻
My focus is on writing maintainable, scalable and testable code, with a preference for functional programming and strong typing. 
I use linux as a daily-driver, love open-source and any software that allows its community to break it, fix it and make it better. 🐧

I have professional experience as a web developer (full-stack in the JS environment), but I love local-first software and TUI applications; in the future I'd love to build something using [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).🧋

I'm also a member of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed and diverse community of programmers based in New York. 
Some projects I've built during my batch are: [Markdown2anki](https://github.com/Mochitto/Markdown2Anki), a fully typed Python CLI tool that bridges the gap between Anki and Markdown files, and [Type-config](https://github.com/Mochitto/type-config), a Python library that validates and casts types onto a custom configuration file format. 

## ✨ Latest projects
I've recently redesigned and rebuilt the [Jolly residence's website](http://jollyresidence.it) using Next.js, React, Shadcn and Taliwind and I've published a study on [exporting huge XLSX](https://github.com/Mochitto/blog_Exporting-huge-XLSX-files) files using dockerized PHP and PSQL.

## 🌱 Currently working on
I'm working on a building my blog/website at [mochitto.dev](http://mochitto.dev) using HTMX, Go, PSQL and Taliwind ⭐
I'm also planning on building projects I've prototyped during my batch at the Recurse Center, once my blog will be ready :)

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on new challenges. 
Feel free to check out my GitHub repositories and get in touch if you're interested in collaborating, have any question or would just like to say 'hi'! 💕
