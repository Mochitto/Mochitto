## 🌸 Hello there!
I'm ✨ Mochi ✨ (or Mochitto!).
My pronouns are: They/them 🏳️‍🌈

I have a background in Japanese language and studies, and a passion for programming. 👩‍💻
Despite having no previous professional experience in software development (yet!), I've spent the last two years immersing myself in the world of programming, learning new languages, frameworks and methodologies, and building open source projects. 🔧

My focus is on writing maintainable, scalable and testable code, with a preference for functional programming and strong typing. 
I'm also familiar with the Linux environment and tooling. 🐧

I'm also a member of the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed and diverse community of programmers based in New York. 
Some projects I've built during my batch are: [Markdown2anki](https://github.com/Mochitto/Markdown2Anki), a fully typed Python tool that bridges the gap between Anki and Markdown files, and [Type-config](https://github.com/Mochitto/type-config), a Python library that validates and casts types onto a custom configuration file format. 

## 🌱 Currently working on
I'm working on my personal website, [Mochitto.dev](https://Mochitto.dev), which showcases my projects, my art and my writing. ⭐
It's built with Next.js and PostgreSQL.
